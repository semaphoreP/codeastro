    "2. Use `numpy` functions whenever possible for matrix operations\n",

    "4. If MKL/BLAS is being run inside of already-parallelized code, disable MKL/BLAS (see Day 1 parallelization materials for more details on MKL/BLAS).\n",
    "5. Reduce the number of iterations or increase the tolerance of routines that are unncessarily precise (e.g., optimizers can run for less iterations; sin and cos can be approximated by taylor expansions). \n",
    "6. Avoid copying variables when they do not need to be copied (e.g., if the input is already a numpy.array, you don't need to wrap it with `np.array()` to ensure it's a numpy array). \n",

If a piece of code takes 10% of the runtime, a factor of 2 improvement (which by itself is often hard to get) only gives you a 5% improvement in the end. **Focus your effort on optimizing the runtime of the one or two functions that take the most amount of time.**\n",

(In CS terms, this is often disccused in \"Big O\" notation as  $O(N^a)$ runtime). If your data is too big or takes too long to benchmark on a single machine, try running your code on much smaller data. If you do this for ~3-5 different test data with different N, you can estimate what is the scaling of your code (i.e., what is \"a\"). Once you know the scaling you can use that scaling relation to extrapolate how long it will take on larger datasets. If you can also use more cores, you can divide the final runtime by the number of cores you can use. \n",

My code scales as (N/10)^2 where N is the size of one dimension of the data. If I want to run it on 10000x10000 data with 100 cores, my code should take (1000^2)/100 = 10,000 seconds to run. In practice there will probably be some deviations to these estimates (due to overheads, CPU usage scheudling, other factors), but this scaling should give you a general sense of how long something will take. \n",
