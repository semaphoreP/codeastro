# Day 2

## Project Goal:

Get a feature working and committed to Github. You'll be busy later this week doing documentation and other scaffolding, so try to finish something you can demo today.

Example:  We’ll continue working on the core functionality we sketched out yesterday so that we can produce a plot of likely galactic orbits given a Gaia star ID.
 
## Learning Objectives

  * Reason about git to understand how to use it to version control your code
  * Interactively debug code using breakpoints, and not rely on print statements
  * Employ best practices for using numpy, pandas, matplotlib & astropy in open-source packages, and explain the purposes of each of these packages.

    * 1 person should be the facilitator: keep track of time, stay on track, and keep track of progress
    * 1 person should be the recorder: writes down the solution (suggestion: use powerpoint, keynote, or google slides to draw out the git commit tree)
