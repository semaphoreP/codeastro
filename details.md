## Recording Policy
We are going to record to workshop to enable broader access to the materials from Code/Astro. We will share the recordings publicly on Youtube. By attending Code/Astro either in-person or remotely, you consent to being recorded. Please contact us if you wish to be removed from recordings.

## In-Person Logistics 

### Morning Session
Breakfast and the morning sessions will be held in the [Northwestern Technological Institute (often called "Tech")](https://g.co/kgs/V5suWjm), an auditorium located on the ground floor. Tech is a 25-minute walk from the Holiday Inn hotel. The 201 bus can also be used to arrive at Tech. Tech can be confusing to navigate, but there is a website called [Tech Room Finder](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/contact/tech-room-finder-map.php?id=L171&room-floor=1&room-id=789&room-ingress=) to assist. 


### Lunch
Lunch is on-your-own (see below for more information). Note that it is a 20-minute walk to our afternoon location, but there are lunch options on Noyes St. and in Downtown Evanston that are only a small detour on the way there.


### Afternoon Session
Afternoon sessions will be held in [1800 Sherman Ave, Evanston, IL 60201](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1800+Sherman+Ave,+Evanston,+IL+60201/@42.050331,-87.6846099,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x880fd00bfa3632f3:0x8d6a9629f47228ab!8m2!3d42.050331!4d-87.682035!16s%2Fg%2F1thtdqy6?entry=ttu). We have several spaces on the 8th floor in 1800 Sherman for you to work on your 
groups projects in the afternoon in (see below for more information). 
The instructors and TAs will be available there in the afternoon in those rooms to help answer any
questions, or discuss your project with you.

There will be nothing planned on Wednesday afternoon (although the rooms are available if you want to work on your project), as this gives you an opportunity to have some time to explore Evanston and Chicago.
We will also host a workshop dinner on Wednesday evening at 6:30pm at Five and Dime, which is located in downtown Evanston. 

### COVID Policy
Masking is optional. If you do test positive for COVID, please let us know and attend the workshop remotely. We can cover costs for you to properly quarantine in a hotel room until you recover. 

### 1800 Sherman In-Person Rooms
1800 Sherman houses CIERA (the astronomy research unit at Northwestern), so you may bump into other astronomers. Group work spaces are located on the 8th floor. Spaces are first-come-first-serve, so you and your group should decide where you want to work.

Below are maps of the rooms in each floor. Please let us know if there are insufficient plugs, and we can bring more. Please keep the areas clean as these are shared areas!
