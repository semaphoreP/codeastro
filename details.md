## Recording Policy
We are going to record to workshop to enable broader access to the materials from Code/Astro. We will share the recordings publicly on Youtube. By attending Code/Astro either in-person or remotely, you consent to being recorded. Please contact us if you wish to be removed from recordings.

## In-Person Logistics 

Code/Astro will be held in [1800 Sherman Ave, Evanston, IL 60201](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1800+Sherman+Ave,+Evanston,+IL+60201/@42.050331,-87.6846099,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x880fd00bfa3632f3:0x8d6a9629f47228ab!8m2!3d42.050331!4d-87.682035!16s%2Fg%2F1thtdqy6?entry=ttu).
Breakfast and the morning sessions will be held in Room 7-600, a big conference room on the 7th floor of 1800 Sherman. 
Lunch is on-your-own, but you are located right across the street from downtown Evanston, so you should have plenty of options (see below for more information).
We have several spaces on the 8th floor in 1800 Sherman for you to work on your 
groups projects in the afternoon in (see below for more information). 
The instructors and TAs will be available there in the afternoon in those rooms to help answer any
questions, or discuss your project with you.

There will be nothing planned on Wednesday afternoon (although the rooms are available if you want to work on your project), as this gives you an opportunity to have some time to explore Evanston and Chicago.
We will also host a workshop dinner on Wednesday evening at 6:30pm at Five and Dime, which is located in downtown Evanston. 

### COVID Policy
Masking is optional. If you do test positive for COVID, please let us know and attend the workshop remotely. We can cover costs for you to properly quarantine in a hotel room until you recover. 

### In-Person Rooms
All synchronous activities in the morning will be held on the 7th floor. Group work spaces are located on the 8th floor. Spaces are first-come-first-serve, so you and your group should decide where you want to work.

Below are maps of the rooms in each floor. Please let us know if there are insufficient plugs, and we can bring more. Please keep the areas clean as these are shared areas!
